# flask-webapp

This webapp, built with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), was created based on [this tutorial](http://jonathansoma.com/tutorials/flask-sqlalchemy-mapbox/getting-started-with-flask.html) from Jonathan Soma. I built it to test which Python web framework I prefer (this or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)) in order to buid a personal website.

This is a very bare bones app that displays data on New York schools. Pages are created for each borough and zip code of New York, and then each school has its own page, where the location of the school is displayed in a map of New York using [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

The verdict: Flask is very simple and easy to understand! This means that it was a great introduction to back-end web programming, since there aren't a lot of moving parts. However, I bet that building out anything more polished will take more work compared to Django, which is more of a "batteries-included" framework. We shall see.
